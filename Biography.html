                <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
                <p>Born in 1936, Margaret Hamilton continues to make significant contributions to the field of computer science until these days. Renowned for her significant role in NASA's Apollo space missions, she is hailed as a trailblazer in the realm of software engineering.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="part2">
                <h2>Career Highlights</h2>
                <p>During the early 1960s, she collaborated with one of the pioneers of Chaos Theory, Professor Lorenz, programming meteorological simulations for his work. Although Lorenz acknowledged her contributions, they are often overlooked in later histories of chaos theory. (Cassel 2022)<sup><a href="#part5"> 1</a></sup></p>
                <p>Following her tenure at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton joined the Apollo Project. As the first female programmer on the team, she undertook the monumental task of developing the on-board flight software. At that time, software engineering was still an emerging concept. (Corbyn 2019)<sup><a href="#part5"> 2</a></sup></p>
                <p>According to Margaret herself, "it was considered to be quite amusing. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas" (Hancock 2014)<sup><a href="#part5"> 3</a></sup>, but as the project progressed, Hamilton's team grew to around 100 engineers. With her accumulation of experience, she introduced the concept of "systems simulation," which encompassed both hardware and digital simulations of Apollo missions.</p>
                <p>Hamilton and her team also formulated their own software engineering rules, overcoming bureaucratic challenges from NASA to ensure mission success. (Cameron 2018)<sup><a href="#part5"> 4</a></sup>Her work on software reliability and error detection was exemplified by the Priority Display Error Detection and Recovery program used during the Apollo 11 landing.<sup><a href="#part5"> 2</a></sup></p>
                <p>Her practical experiences were later formalized into systems and software theory, leaving a lasting impact on the software engineering field.</p>

                <h2>Contributions and Legacy</h2>
                <div id="contribution1">
                    <h3>Pioneering Software Engineering</h3>
                    <p>Hamilton is credited with coining the term "software engineering," transforming the software development process into a structured discipline. Her ideas, such as asynchronous software, priority scheduling, and man-in-the-loop decision capabilities, formed the foundation for reliable software design. (NASA Office 2004)<sup><a href="#part5"> 5</a></sup></p>

                <div class="motto">
                    <h3>"There was no choice but to be pioneers."</h3>
                    <h4>— Margaret Hamilton</h4>
                </div>
                <div id="contribution2">
                    <h3>Advancing the Industry</h3>
                    <p>She established several influential companies, including HOS and Hamilton Technology, and developed innovative products. The "001" tool her company developed guaranteed "All aspects of the system design are expressed in the same "language," from the highest level concepts to the most detailed implementation specifics" (Krut 1993)<sup><a href="#part5"> 6</a></sup></p>
                </div>
                <div id="contribution3">
                    <h3>Continued Impact</h3>
                    <p>Margaret Hamilton remains actively engaged in the software engineering field. In recognition of her contributions, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. Until these days, she has shared her valuable insights at conferences and in interviews. Hamilton's dedication and pioneering spirit continue to inspire people in the computer science field, particularly encouraging women to pursue careers in computer science.</p>
