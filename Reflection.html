                <h2>Short Insight</h2>
                <p>C119 - Computational Thinking course marked our initiation into the Computing degree program. It introduced us to two main components: computational thinking and the essential tools for web design, encompassing HTML/CSS and JavaScript. In the course, we twist together these elements each week, delving into fundamental programming and algorithmic concepts across multiple programming languages.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <div id="week1">
                    <h3>Week1</h3>
                    <p>In the first week, I built an initial understanding of computational and learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Also, I ventured into crafting my first web page using HTML and CSS. This process required meticulous attention to detail in programming. I have been acutely aware of the importance of semicolons using properly enclosed curly brackets, accurate variable names, and the importance of writing relative addresses. The experience of crafting web pages has made me understand the necessity of avoiding such detail-oriented mistakes in all my future coursework.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="week2">
                    <h3> Week2</h3>
                    <p>The second week of the course explored computational thinking concepts deeply, using specific programming languages as illustrative examples. This deeper dive provided insights into the limitations of computing, such as the inherent imprecision of floating point calculations. It underscored the finite nature of computer capabilities governed by the underlying hardware construction. </p>
                    <p>Simultaneously, I continued to enhance my grasp of HTML and CSS and began learning JavaScript. Concepts like responsive design, the versatility of modern CSS, and its capacity to create impressive effects came to the forefront. During this week, our group undertook a collaborative assignment, and I effectively led the team and organized discussions. My focus was on advanced paradigms like building websites modularly, employing standardized language, and using structural elements like &#60;header&#62;, &#60;main&#62;, and &#60;footer&#62; judiciously while adhering to standardized header statements such as &#60;h1&#62;. This contributed to code organization, facilitated proper rendering in browsers and enhanced accessibility for individuals with disabilities, aligning with my belief in technology for justice.</p>

                <h2>Contribution for Future</h2>
                <p>After completing this course, I am confident that this experience has significantly contributed to my year-long course. Firstly, it has illuminated the essential shift in the thinking paradigm when transitioning from a legal background to computer science. Legal thinking primarily concerns interactions with people, while computational thinking entails breaking down tasks into comprehensible steps for computers. Legal practice needs extensive reading, while computer science demands consistent hands-on practice, embodying knowledge through practical application.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I've acquired the skill of initiating programming projects from the very beginning. This entails creating a project file in an integrated development environment, ideally with a Git repository, to streamline version management across different devices. Then, guided by a computational mindset, I have learned to systematically outline each step and translate it into a concrete program. Significantly, I have embraced the reality that initial attempts may fail, encountering bugs or unimplemented features. Encountering these challenges has been vital, as I initially relied heavily on AI and search engines to resolve issues. Nevertheless, I realized the importance of independent problem-solving, referring to existing solutions primarily as a reference for algorithms and turning to official language documentation for element, method, or function usage.</p>
                <p>In summary, this course has provided me with a clear roadmap for navigating the learning process within a computer science program. It emphasizes the need for continuous practical application to acquire the knowledge and skills essential to succeed under the guidance of the course requirements and assessment criteria. Armed with these insights and expectations, I am better equipped to tackle future courses and academic challenges.</p>
