                <h2>Short Insight</h2>
                <p>Computational thinking is a problem-solving methodology aimed at achieving specific objectives. The solution developed through computational thinking is comprehensible and executable by humans and machines, "or more generally, by combinations of humans and machines. (Wing 2006)"<sup><a href="#part5"> 1</a></sup></p>
            </div>
            <div id="part2">
                <h2>Futher Explanation</h2>
                <p>At its core, computational thinking is encapsulated by a structured process, often referred to as "decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm". These four key techniques equip us with the tools to tackle intricate issues in complex systems. It begins by segmenting a problem and then abstracting its specific components. This abstraction enables people to recognise distinctive patterns with prior knowledge and experiences. Finally, step-by-step solutions to the problem can be constructed using these insights.</p>
                <p>Although the concept of computational thinking is closely intertwined with the evolution of computer science (Tedre et al. 2016; Denning and Tedre 2019)<sup><a href="#part5"> 2, 3</a></sup>, it has deep roots in human thought processes dating back to earlier times. These days, it has transformed into a more universal mode of thinking that extends beyond computer science. It is indispensable not only for programming but also for various other professional endeavours.</p>

                <h2>Future Study</h2>
                <p>In computer science studies, computational thinking is the cornerstone. It plays a dual role: in specific programming tasks, it offers indispensable guidance for students to ensure the creation of functional code. Simultaneously, computational thinking is crucial in more extensive projects. For example, in our software engineering course, which has started recently,  groupmates are asked to collaborate to develop a functional product. In this process, computational thinking is expected to facilitate breaking broad objectives into a coherent product plan. This plan will include specific steps for teammates to follow, such as task allocation, project coordination, and meticulous product testing. Therefore, it can be seen that computational thinking must be the driving force behind tasks, both programming-related and beyond, to reach academic success.</p>

                <h2>Future Career</h2>
                <p>As we look forward to our future careers, we find that the demands within the expansive computer science fields encompass more than programming. In this case, computational thinking equips us with the skills and mindset to operate at a heightened level of complexity. For instance, algorithm design and analysis allow us to grapple with the intricacy of problems and create more efficient algorithms. In software engineering, it empowers us to manage the entire software development life cycle with precision. In data analysis, which calls for a deep understanding of data modelling, computational thinking paves the way for practical application.</p>
                <p>Today, computational thinking is not confined to the boundaries of computer science. Its applications exist in numerous industries and disciplines. Beyond the evident need for computation in science and engineering, its impact extends to humanities, media arts, economics, and finance. Harnessing the power of computational thinking helps us explore more interdisciplinary fields at the crossroads of technology and innovation.</p>
